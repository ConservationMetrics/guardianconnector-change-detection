# GuardianConnector Change Detection

A Dockerized Python script which processes a GeoJSON input and generates several outputs for rendering on satellite imagery maps. In addition, it prepares offline map resources to load the data in data collection applications such as Kobo/ODK Collect and Mapeo.

You can execute this script in one of three ways:
1) using Docker Compose
2) directly with Python (which will require installing some dependencies)
3) via HTTP service endpoint (also running in Docker)

## Steps

The script follows these steps:

1. Copy GeoJSON file to outputs directory
2. Get bounding box for GeoJSON (all features)
3. Generate HTML Mapbox map for previewing change detection alert
4. Generate vector MBTiles from GeoJSON
5. Generate raster XYZ tiles from satellite imagery and bounding box
6. Convert raster XYZ directory to MBTiles
7. Generate stylesheet with both raster and vector MBTiles files
8. Download and copy over fonts and glyphs (needed for map style)
9. Generate overlay map HTML map (to preview style)
10. Serve maps using `tileserver-gl`
11. Generate composite MBTiles from `tileserver-gl` map loading the style

For Python, these steps are all contained in the gccd package's `main.py` script. For Docker, we need to split these up due to compose service orchestration; steps 1-9 are handled in  `docker-generate.py`, step 10 is handled by running a `tileserver-gl` service, and step 11 is handled in `docker-tileserver-compile.py`.

## Run the script with Docker Compose

Execute the script using the command:

```
./run.sh --input [FILENAME].geojson --output [OUTPUT]
```

The `--output` flag is optional and can be used to name the directory and any files like MBTiles differently than your input file. If omitted, the script will employ the input filename for outputs.

## Run the script with Python

See [`gccd_pkg/README.md`](gccd_pkg/README.md).

## Run the flow via HTTP service endpoint

See [`httpservice/README.md`](httpservice/README.md).

## How to use the outputs

For **ODK/Kobo Collect**, you can use the final raster tileset as a background map for any geo fields by [transferring them to your device](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-offline-maps/). This process is still somewhat cumbersome, involving either the use of a USB cable or `adb` (see link). Also, while ODK/Kobo Collect can render the vector MBTiles, it is done without styling; each feature is displayed in a different color picked by the applications.

 **Mapeo** can import raster MBTiles files directly using the background map manager UI. In the future, Mapeo will be able to render vector MBTiles too, and we can then retool this script (using the outputs in the `mapbox-map/` directory) to generate a file that conforms to the expected input from Mapeo.
